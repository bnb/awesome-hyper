## Adding to this list

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Search previous requests for additions to awesome-hyper before making a new one - your request may be a duplicate.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion to `awesome-hyper`.
- For Hyper **package** and **theme** names, please use the package name as published on npm, and as displayed in the URI of the package. 
  - As an example, the title of `https://www.npmjs.com/package/hyper-snazzy` would be `hyper-snazzy`
- For new suggestions, use the following formatting `[hyper-plugin-name](link) - Your awesome description | [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/hyper-plugin-name.svg?label=DL)]()`
  - As an example, here's how `hyper-snazzy` would be formatted:
  - `[hyper-snazzy](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hyper-snazzy) - A super snazzy theme for Hyper, with muted off-neon colors. | [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/hyper-snazzy.svg?label=DL)]()`
- Link additions should be added to the **BOTTOM** or inserted according to the **ALPHABETICAL** order:
  - If it's a plugin or resource, put your awesome item at the **BOTTOM** of the correct section.
  - If it's a theme, insert it according to the **ALPHABETICAL** order.
- New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are _always_ welcome.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
- The pull request and commit should have a useful title.

Suggestions for ammendments to these guidelines are always welcome - feel free to submit an issue or pull request.
